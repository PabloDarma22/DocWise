## What [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/health/nightscout\#what "Direct link to What")

[Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) (CGM in the Cloud) is an open source,
DIY project that allows real time access to a CGM data via an HTTP REST API. It
is used for secure remote viewing of blood sugar data from anywhere...including
Oh My Posh segments on the command line!

## Sample Configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/health/nightscout\#sample-configuration "Direct link to Sample Configuration")

This example is using mg/dl by default because the Nightscout API sends the sugar
glucose value (.Sgv) in mg/dl format. Below is also a template for displaying the
glucose value in mmol/L. When using different color ranges you should multiply your
high and low range glucose values by 18 and use these values in the templates.
You'll also want to think about your background and foreground colors. Don't use
white text on a yellow background, for example.

The `foreground_templates` example below could be set to just a single color,
if that color is visible against any of your backgrounds.

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "type": "nightscout",
  "style": "diamond",
  "foreground": "#ffffff",
  "background": "#ff0000",
  "background_templates": [\
    "{{ if gt .Sgv 150 }}#FFFF00{{ end }}",\
    "{{ if lt .Sgv 60 }}#FF0000{{ end }}",\
    "#00FF00"\
  ],
  "foreground_templates": [\
    "{{ if gt .Sgv 150 }}#000000{{ end }}",\
    "{{ if lt .Sgv 60 }}#000000{{ end }}",\
    "#000000"\
  ],
  "leading_diamond": "î‚¶",
  "trailing_diamond": "î‚°",
  "template": "îŠ¡ {{ .Sgv }}{{ .TrendIcon }}",
  "properties": {
    "url": "https://YOURNIGHTSCOUTAPP.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries.json?count=1&token=APITOKENFROMYOURADMIN",
    "http_timeout": 1500
  }
}

```

Or display in mmol/l (instead of the default mg/dl) with the following template:

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "template": "îŠ¡ {{ if eq (mod .Sgv 18) 0 }}{{divf .Sgv 18}}.0{{ else }} {{ round (divf .Sgv 18) 1 }}{{ end }}{{ .TrendIcon }}"
}

```

## Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/health/nightscout\#properties "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` |  | Your Nightscout URL, including the full path to entries.json AND count=1 AND token. Example above. You'll know this works if you can curl it yourself and get a single value |
| `headers` | `map[string]string` |  | A key, value map of Headers to send with the request |
| `http_timeout` | `int` | `500` | in milliseconds - how long do you want to wait before you want to see your prompt more than your sugar? I figure a half second is a good default |

info

You can change the icons for trend, put the trend elsewhere, add text, however you like!
Make sure your NerdFont has the glyph you want or [search for one](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DoubleUpIcon` | defaults to `â†‘â†‘` |
| `SingleUpIcon` | defaults to `â†‘` |
| `FortyFiveUpIcon` | defaults to `â†—` |
| `FlatIcon` | defaults to `â†’` |
| `FortyFiveDownIcon` | defaults to `â†˜` |
| `SingleDownIcon` | defaults to `â†“` |
| `DoubleDownIcon` | defaults to `â†“â†“` |
