The standard initialization sets Oh My Posh' default, built-in theme.

To set a new configugration or theme you need to change the `--config` option of the `oh-my-posh init <shell>`
line in your `profile` or `.<shell>rc` script (see [prompt](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/prompt)).

These are the three possible values the `--config` flag can handle:

- a pointer to a theme, without the extensions





```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
  --config 'jandedobbeleer'

```

- a path to a local configuration file





```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
  --config 'C:/Users/Posh/myconfig.omp.json'

```

- a URL pointing to a remote config





```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
  --config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json'

```


### Set the configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize\#set-the-configuration "Direct link to Set the configuration")

The example below use a local path to the [jandedobbeleer](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#jandedobbeleer) theme, adjust the `--config` value
to reflect your configuration file, local or remote.

- bash
- cmd
- elvish
- fish
- nu
- powershell
- xonsh
- zsh

Adjust the Oh My Posh init line in your `$PROFILE` by adding the `--config` flag with the location
of your configuration.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config ~/jandedobbeleer.omp.json | Invoke-Expression

```

Once altered, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
. $PROFILE

```

info

When the above command gives an error, make sure to create the profile first and add the `oh-my-posh init` above.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force

```

In this scenario, it can also be that PowerShell blocks running local scripts. To solve that, set PowerShell
to only require remote scripts to be signed using `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`, or [sign the profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing?view=powershell-7.3#methods-of-signing-scripts).

wsl

When using oh-my-posh in Windows and the WSL, know that you can **share your theme with the WSL** by pointing to a theme in your
Windows user's home folder.

Inside the WSL, you can find your Windows user's home folder here: `/mnt/c/Users/<WINDOWSUSERNAME>`.

### Custom configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize\#custom-configuration "Direct link to Custom configuration")

Maybe there's a theme you like, but you don't fancy the colors. Or, maybe there's a segment you
want to tweak/add, or replace some of the icons with a different one. Whatever the case, **read through**
**available options first**, by starting with the [configuration](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/general).

You can export the current theme (default, or set via `--config`) to the format you like ( `json`, `yaml`, or `toml`)
which can be used to tweak and store as your own custom configuration.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh config export --config jandedobbeleer --output ~/.mytheme.omp.json

```

#### Previewing changes [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize\#previewing-changes "Direct link to Previewing changes")

If you want to preview your changes, you can use the following command to render every configured prompt.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh print preview

```

Use the `--force` flag in case you want to render all segments, regardless of the current context.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh print preview --force

```

### Read the docs [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize\#read-the-docs "Direct link to Read the docs")
