## What [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#what "Direct link to What")

Display Plastic SCM information when in a plastic repository. Also works for subfolders.
For maximum compatibility, make sure your `cm` executable is up-to-date
(when branch or status information is incorrect for example).

## Properties [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### Fetching information [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#fetching-information "Direct link to Fetching information")

As doing multiple `cm` calls can slow down the prompt experience, we do not fetch information by default.
You can set the following property to `true` to enable fetching additional information (and populate the template).

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch_status` | `boolean` | `false` | fetch the local changes |
| `status_formats` | `map[string]string` |  | a key, value map allowing to override how individual status items are displayed. For example, `"status_formats": { "Added": "Added: %d" }` will display the added count as `Added: 1` instead of `+1`. See the [Status](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic#status) section for available overrides |

### Icons [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#icons "Direct link to Icons")

#### Branch [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#branch "Direct link to Branch")

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `branch_icon` | `string` | `\uE0A0` | the icon to use in front of the git branch name |
| `mapped_branches` | `object` |  | custom glyph/text for specific branches. You can use `*` at the end as a wildcard character for matching |
| `branch_template` | `string` |  | a [template](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates) to format that branch name. You can use `{{ .Branch }}` as reference to the original branch name |

#### Selector [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/plastic\#selector "Direct link to Selector")

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `commit_icon` | `string` | `\uF417` | icon/text to display before the commit context (detached HEAD) |
| `tag_icon` | `string` | `\uF412` | icon/text to display before the tag context |
