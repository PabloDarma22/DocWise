## What [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/music/ytm\#what "Direct link to What")

Shows the currently playing song in the [YouTube Music Desktop App](https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop).

## Setup [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/music/ytm\#setup "Direct link to Setup")

You need to enable the Companion API in the YouTube Music Desktop App settings.
To do this, open the app, go to `Settings > Integration` and enable the following:

- Companion server
- Enable companion authentication

From the CLI, run the following command to set the authentication token:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh auth ytmda

```

If done correctly, you should now be able to add the `ytm` segment to your prompt.

rate limiting

The YouTube Music Desktop App has a pretty strict rate limit. Therefore it is recommended
to set the `cache` property in your configuration. If you don't, the segment will not be able
to display correctly.
