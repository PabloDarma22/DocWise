## What [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/battery\#what "Direct link to What")

caution

The segment is not supported and automatically disabled on Windows when WSL 1 is detected. Works fine with WSL 2.

Battery displays the remaining power percentage for your battery.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `display_error` | `boolean` | `false` | show the error context when failing to retrieve the battery information |
| `charging_icon` | `string` |  | icon to display when charging |
| `discharging_icon` | `string` |  | icon to display when discharging |
| `charged_icon` | `string` |  | icon to display when fully charged |
| `not_charging_icon` | `string` |  | icon to display when fully charged |

### Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/battery\#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.State` | `struct` | the battery state, has a `.String` function |
| `.Current` | `float64` | Current (momentary) charge rate (in mW). |
| `.Full` | `float64` | Last known full capacity (in mWh) |
| `.Design` | `float64` | Reported design capacity (in mWh) |
| `.ChargeRate` | `float64` | Current (momentary) charge rate (in mW). It is always non-negative, consult .State field to check whether it means charging or discharging (on some systems this might be always `0` if the battery doesn't support it) |
| `.Voltage` | `float64` | Current voltage (in V) |
| `.DesignVoltage` | `float64` | Design voltage (in V). Some systems (e.g. macOS) do not provide a separate value for this. In such cases, or if getting this fails, but getting `Voltage` succeeds, this field will have the same value as `Voltage`, for convenience |
| `.Percentage` | `float64` | the current battery percentage |
| `.Error` | `string` | the error in case fetching the battery information failed |
| `.Icon` | `string` | the icon based on the battery state |
