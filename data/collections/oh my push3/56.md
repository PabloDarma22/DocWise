### Nerd Fonts [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#nerd-fonts "Direct link to Nerd Fonts")

Oh My Posh was designed to use [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Nerd Fonts are popular fonts that are patched to include icons.
To see the icons displayed in Oh My Posh, **install** a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), and **configure** your terminal to use it.

info

Fonts need to be installed on the host system as this is a UI setting, not a command line, or shell configuration.
This means **when running inside a container or WSL**, you need to install the font on the host system and configure
your terminal emulator to use it.

### Installation [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#installation "Direct link to Installation")

- Oh My Posh
- homebrew

Oh My Posh has a CLI to help you select and install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/):

info

When running as root/administrator, the fonts will be installed system-wide.
When running as a regular user, the fonts will be installed in the user's font directory.
By default, Oh My Posh installs the `.ttf` version of the font in case multiple versions are available.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh font install

```

This will present a list of Nerd Font libraries, from which you can select `Meslo`, which includes the `Meslo LGM NF` font we recommend. Note that you can also install it directly via:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh font install meslo

```

### Configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Make sure to **configure your terminal** to use the font you have installed. The following sections will show you how to do this for the most popular terminals.

- Windows Terminal
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio

Once you have installed a Nerd Font, you will need to configure the Windows Terminal to use it. This can be easily done
by modifying the Windows Terminal settings (default shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + ,`). In your `settings.json` file, add the
`font.face` attribute under the `defaults` attribute in `profiles`:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
    "profiles":
    {
        "defaults":
        {
            "font":
            {
                "face": "MesloLGM Nerd Font"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Other Fonts [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#other-fonts "Direct link to Other Fonts")

If you are not interested in using a Nerd Font, you will want to use a theme which doesn't include any Nerd Font icons.
The `minimal` themes do not make use of Nerd Font icons.

[Creating your own theme](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize) is always an option too ðŸ˜Š
