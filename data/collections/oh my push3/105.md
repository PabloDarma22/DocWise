tip

If you have no idea which shell you're currently using, Oh My Posh has a utility switch that can tell that to you.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh get shell

```

- bash
- cmd
- elvish
- fish
- nu
- powershell
- xonsh
- zsh

Edit your PowerShell profile script, you can find its location under the `$PROFILE` variable in your preferred PowerShell version. For example, using notepad:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
notepad $PROFILE

```

info

When the above command gives an error, make sure to create the profile first.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force

```

In this scenario, it can also be that PowerShell blocks running local scripts. To solve that, set PowerShell
to only require remote scripts to be signed using `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine`, or [sign the profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing?view=powershell-7.3#methods-of-signing-scripts).

Add the following snippet as the last line to your PowerShell profile script:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression

```

Execution policy

In case the execution policy disables executing unsigned scripts on your system, you can fallback to evaluating
the script instead. Use the `--eval` flag to do so:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
oh-my-posh init pwsh --eval | Invoke-Expression

```

Be aware this will make initializing the shell slower.

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
. $PROFILE

```
