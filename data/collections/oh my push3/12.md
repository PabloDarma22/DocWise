### Fetching information [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/jujutsu\#fetching-information "Direct link to Fetching information")

As doing Jujutsu (jj) calls can slow down the prompt experience, we do not fetch information by default.
Set `status_formats` to `true` to enable fetching additional information (and populate the template).

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch_status` | `boolean` | `false` | fetch the local changes |
| `ignore_working_copy` | `boolean` | `true` | don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it |
| `native_fallback` | `boolean` | `false` | when set to `true` and `jj.exe` is not available when inside a WSL2 shared Windows drive, we will fallback to the native `jj` executable to fetch data. Not all information can be displayed in this case |
| `status_formats` | `map[string]string` |  | a key, value map allowing to override how individual status items are displayed. For example, `"status_formats": { "Added": "Added: %d" }` will display the added count as `Added: 1` instead of `+1`. See the [Status](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/jujutsu#status) section for available overrides |

## Template ( [info](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/config-templates)) [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/jujutsu\#template-info "Direct link to template-info")

default template

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
jj {{.ChangeID}}{{if .Working.Changed}} \uf044 {{ .Working.String }}{{ end }}

```

### Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/jujutsu\#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Working` | `Status` | changes in the working copy (see below) |
| `.ChangeID` | `string` | The shortest unique prefix of the working copy change |

### Status [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/jujutsu\#status "Direct link to Status")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Modified` | `int` | number of modified files |
| `.Deleted` | `int` | number of deleted files |
| `.Added` | `int` | number of added files |
| `.Moved` | `int` | number of renamed files |
| `.Changed` | `boolean` | if the status contains changes or not |
| `.String` | `string` | a string representation of the changes above |

Local changes use the following syntax:

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `~` | Modified |
| `-` | Deleted |
| `+` | Added |
| `>` | Moved |
