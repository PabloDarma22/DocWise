## Problem statement [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#problem-statement "Direct link to Problem statement")

Traditionally, the module was the only way to install oh-my-posh using `Install-Module oh-my-posh`.
Today, with the shift to the executable version over a year ago, it only acts as a wrapper around the
executable, offering no additional functionality. Throughout the year, the following changes have been made:

- don't ship all binaries in the Module but download on `Import-Module`
- move all functionality from the Module to the [init](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/src/shell/scripts/omp.ps1) script

There's a problem with the Module due to the following:

- downloading the binary is a problem on company managed computers
- the module syncs cross device thanks to OneDrive sync, causing versions to be out of sync and [configs to break](https://ohmyposh.dev/blog/idiots-everywhere)
- it's impactful having to explain the difference time and time again (for me)

If you're still using `Set-PoshPrompt`, replace that statement with the following:
