## What [‚Äã](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/music/spotify\#what "Direct link to What")

Show the currently playing song in the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) client.

caution

Be aware this can make the prompt a tad bit slower as it needs to get a response from the Spotify player.

On _macOS & Linux_, all states are supported (playing/paused/stopped).

On _Windows/WSL_, **only the playing state is supported** (no information when paused/stopped). It supports
fetching information from the native Spotify application and Edge PWA.
