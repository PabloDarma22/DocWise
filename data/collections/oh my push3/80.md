## What [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#what "Direct link to What")

Calling all brewers! Keep up-to-date with the status of your [Brewfather](http://brewfather.app/) batch directly in your
commandline prompt using the brewfather segment!

You will need your User ID and API Key as generated in
Brewfather's Settings screen, enabled with **batches.read** and **recipes.read** scopes.

## Sample Configuration [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#sample-configuration "Direct link to Sample Configuration")

This example uses the default segment template to show a rendition of detail appropriate to the status of the batch

Additionally, the background of the segment will turn red if the latest reading is over 4 hours old - possibly helping indicate
an issue if, for example there is a Tilt or similar device that is supposed to be logging to Brewfather every 15 minutes.

info

Temperature units are in degrees C and specific gravity is expressed as `X.XXX` values.

## Template ( [info](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates)) [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#template-info "Direct link to template-info")

default template

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{{ .StatusIcon }} {{ if .DaysBottledOrFermented }}{{ .DaysBottledOrFermented }}{{ .DayIcon }} {{ end }}{{ url .Recipe.Name .URL }} {{ printf \"%.1f\" .MeasuredAbv }}%{{ if and (.Reading) (eq .Status \"Fermenting\") }} {{ printf \"%.3f\" .Reading.Gravity }} {{ .Reading.Temperature }}\u00b0 {{ .TemperatureTrendIcon }}{{ end }}

```

### Properties [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |

| .StatusIcon | `string` | Icon representing above stats. Can be overridden with properties shown above |
| .TemperatureTrendIcon | `string` | Icon showing temperature trend based on latest and previous reading |
| .DaysFermenting | `int` | days since start of fermentation |
| .DaysBottled | `int` | days since bottled/kegged |
| .DaysBottledOrFermented | `int` | one of the above, chosen automatically based on batch status |
| .Recipe.Name | `string` | The recipe being brewed in this batch |
| .BatchName | `string` | The name of this batch |
| .BatchNumer | `int` | The number of this batch |
| .MeasuredAbv | `float` | The ABV for the batch - either estimated from recipe or calculated from entered OG and FG values |
| .ReadingAge | `int` | age in hours of most recent reading or -1 if there are no readings available |

#### Reading [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#reading "Direct link to Reading")

`.Reading` contains the most recent data from devices or manual entry as visible on the Brewfather's batch Readings graph.
If there are no readings available, `.Reading` will be null.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| .Reading.Gravity | `float` | specific gravity (in decimal point format) |
| .Reading.Temperature | `float` | temperature in °C |
| .Reading.Time | `int` | unix timestamp of reading |
| .Reading.Comment | `string` | comment attached to this reading |
| .Reading.DeviceType | `string` | source of the reading, e.g. "Tilt" |

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.URL` | `string` | the URL for the batch in the Brewfather app. You can use this to add a hyperlink to the segment if you are using a terminal that supports it. The default template implements this |

### Advanced Templating [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#advanced-templating "Direct link to Advanced Templating")

The built in template will provides key useful information. However, you can use the properties about the batch
to build your own. For reference, the built-in template looks like this:

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "template": "{{.StatusIcon}} {{if .DaysBottledOrFermented}}{{.DaysBottledOrFermented}}{{.DayIcon}} {{end}}[{{.Recipe.Name}}]({{.URL}}) {{printf \"%.1f\" .MeasuredAbv}}%{{ if and (.Reading) (eq .Status \"Fermenting\")}}: {{printf \"%.3f\" .Reading.Gravity}} {{.Reading.Temperature}}° {{.TemperatureTrendIcon}}{{end}}"
}

```

### Unit conversion [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#unit-conversion "Direct link to Unit conversion")

By default temperature readings are provided in degrees C, gravity readings in decimal Specific Gravity unts (X.XXX).

The following conversion functions are available to the template to convert to other units:

#### Temperature [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#temperature "Direct link to Temperature")

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DegCToF` | input: `float` degrees in C; output `float` degrees in F (1 decimal place) |
| `DegCToKelvin` | input: `float` degrees in C; output `float` Kelvin (1 decimal place) |

#### Gravity [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#gravity "Direct link to Gravity")

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SGToBrix | input `float` SG in x.xxx decimal; output `float` Brix (2 decimal places) |
| SGToPlato | input `float` SG in x.xxx decimal; output `float` Plato (2 decimal places) |

_(These use the polynomial conversions from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix#Specific_gravity_2))_

#### Example [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/brewfather\#example "Direct link to Example")

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "template": "{{if .Reading}}{{.SGToBrix .Reading.Gravity}}°Bx, {{.DegCToF .Reading.Temperature}}°F{{end}}"
}

```

To display gravity as SG in XXXX format (e.g. "1020" instead of "1.020"), use the `mulf` template function

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "template": "{{if .Reading}}{{.mulf 1000 .Reading.Gravity}}, {{.DegCToF .Reading.Temperature}}°F{{end}}"
}

```
