## What [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#what "Direct link to What")

Display subversion information when in a subversion repository. Also works for subfolders. For maximum compatibility,
make sure your `svn` executable is up-to-date (when branch or status information is incorrect for example).

## Sample Configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#sample-configuration "Direct link to Sample Configuration")

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "type": "svn",
  "style": "powerline",
  "powerline_symbol": "î‚°",
  "foreground": "#193549",
  "background": "#ffeb3b",
  "properties": {
    "fetch_status": true
  }
}

```

## Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### Fetching information [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#fetching-information "Direct link to Fetching information")

As doing multiple [subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) calls can slow down the prompt experience, we do not fetch information by default.
You can set the following properties to `true` to enable fetching additional information (and populate the template).

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch_status` | `boolean` | `false` | fetch the local changes |
| `native_fallback` | `boolean` | `false` | when set to `true` and `svn.exe` is not available when inside a WSL2 shared Windows drive, we will fallback to the native `svn` executable to fetch data. Not all information can be displayed in this case |
| `status_formats` | `map[string]string` |  | a key, value map allowing to override how individual status items are displayed. For example, `"status_formats": { "Added": "Added: %d" }` will display the added count as `Added: 1` instead of `+1`. See the [Status](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn#status) section for available overrides |

info

The fields `Repo`, `Branch` and `BaseRev` will still work with `fetch_status` set to `false`.

## Template ( [info](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates)) [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#template-info "Direct link to template-info")

default template

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
 \ue0a0{{.Branch}} r{{.BaseRev}} {{.Working.String}}

```

### Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Working` | `Status` | changes in the worktree (see below) |
| `.Branch` | `string` | current branch (relative URL reported by `svn info`) |
| `.BaseRev` | `int` | the currently checked out revision number |
| `.Repo` | `string` | current repository (repos root URL reported by `svn info`) |

### Status [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/scm/svn\#status "Direct link to Status")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Untracked` | `int` | number of files not under version control |
| `.Modified` | `int` | number of modified files |
| `.Deleted` | `int` | number of deleted files |
| `.Added` | `int` | number of added files |
| `.Moved` | `int` | number of changed moved files |
| `.Conflicted` | `int` | number of changed tracked files with conflicts |
| `.Changed` | `boolean` | if the status contains changes or not |
| `.HasConflicts` | `boolean` | if the status contains conflicts or not |
| `.String` | `string` | a string representation of the changes above |

Local changes use the following syntax:

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `?` | Untracked |
| `~` | Modified |
| `-` | Deleted |
| `+` | Added |
| `>` | Moved |
