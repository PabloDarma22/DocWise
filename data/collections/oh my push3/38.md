## Installation [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows\#installation "Direct link to Installation")

- winget
- manual

Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh --source winget --scope user --force

```

Replace `--scope user` with `--scope machine` if you want to install Oh My Posh for all users on the machine.

info

For the `PATH` to be reloaded, a restart of your terminal is advised.
If oh-my-posh is not recognized as a command, you can run the installer again, or add it manually to your `PATH`.
For example:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\bin"

```

Antivirus software

Due to frequent updates of Oh My Posh, Antivirus software occasionally flags it (false positive).
To ensure Oh My Posh isn't blocked you can either report it to your favorite Antivirus software as a false positive
(e.g. [Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft for analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-autoir-report-false-positives-negatives#report-a-false-positivenegative-to-microsoft-for-analysis)) or create an exclusion for it.
Exclusions should be added with the full path to the executable, you can get it with the following command from a PowerShell prompt:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
(Get-Command oh-my-posh).Source

```
