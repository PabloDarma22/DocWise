## What [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/nba\#what "Direct link to What")

The NBA segment allows you to display the scheduling and score information for your
favorite NBA team!

## Sample Configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/nba\#sample-configuration "Direct link to Sample Configuration")

In order to use the NBA segment, you need to provide a valid team
[tri-code](https://liaison.reuters.com/tools/sports-team-codes) that you'd
like to get data for inside of the configuration. For example, if you'd like
to get information for the Los Angeles Lakers, you'd need to use the "LAL"
tri-code.

This example uses "LAL" to get information for the Los Angeles Lakers. It also
sets the foreground and background colors to match the theming for the team.
If you are interested in getting information about specific foreground and
background colors you could use for other teams, you can explore some of
the color schemes [here](https://teamcolorcodes.com/nba-team-color-codes/).

It is recommended that you set the HTTP timeout to a higher value than the
normal default in case it takes some time to gather the scoreboard information.
In this case we have the http\_timeout set to 1500.

## Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/nba\#properties "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `team` | `string` | tri-code for the NBA team you want to get data for |
| `days_offset` | `int` | how many days in advance you wish to see that information for, defaults to 8 |
| `http_timeout` | `int` | How long do you want to wait before you want to see your prompt more than your sugar? I figure a half second is a good default - defaults to 500ms |
