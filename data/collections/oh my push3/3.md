## Mapped Locations [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#mapped-locations "Direct link to Mapped Locations")

Allows you to override a location with an icon/string.
It validates if the current path **starts with the specific elements** and replaces it with the icon/string if there's a match.
To avoid issues with nested overrides, Oh My Posh will sort the list of mapped locations before doing a replacement.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mapped_locations_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | replace known locations in the path with the replacements before applying the style |
| `mapped_locations` | `object` |  | custom glyph/text for specific paths. Works regardless of the `mapped_locations_enabled` |

setting.

For example, to swap out `C:\Users\Leet\GitHub` with a GitHub icon, you can do the following:

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "mapped_locations": {
    "C:\\Users\\Leet\\GitHub": "ï‚›"
  }
}

```

### How it works [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

- To make mapped locations work cross-platform, use `/` as the path separator, Oh My Posh will
automatically match effective separators based on the running operating system.
- If you want to match all child directories, you can use `*` as a wildcard, for example:
`"C:/Users/Bill/*": "$"` will turn `C:/Users/Bill/Downloads` into `$/Downloads` but leave `C:/Users/Bill` unchanged.
- The character `~` at the start of a mapped location will match the user's home directory.
- The match is _case-insensitive on Windows and macOS_, but case-sensitive on other operating systems. This means that for
user Bill, who has a user account `Bill` on Windows and `bill` on Linux, `~/Foo` might match
`C:\Users\Bill\Foo` or `C:\Users\Bill\foo` on Windows but only `/home/bill/Foo` on Linux.

warning

To prevent mangling path elements, if you use any text style tags (e.g., `<lightGreen>...</>`) in replacement values,
you should avoid using a chevron character ( `<`/ `>`) in the `folder_separator_icon` property, and vice versa.

### Using regular expressions [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#using-regular-expressions "Direct link to Using regular expressions")

For more complicated cases, you can use the `re:` prefix to use a regular expression with a capture group for matching.
This uses Golang's [regexp](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) package, so you can use any of the [supported syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). The replacement value will be the first capture group,
subsequent groups will be ignored.

For example, `"re:(C:/[0-9]+/Foo)": "#"` will match `C:\123\Foo\Bar` and replace it with `#\Bar`. The path used for matching
will always use `/`, regardless of the operating system, allowing cross platform matching.

Same as for standard replacements, the match is case insensitive on Windows and WSL mounted drives, but case-sensitive on
other operating systems.

## Style [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#style "Direct link to Style")

Style sets the way the path is displayed. Based on previous experience and popular themes, there are 10 flavors.

- `agnoster`
- `agnoster_full`
- `agnoster_short`
- `agnoster_left`
- `full`
- `folder`
- `mixed`
- `letter`
- `unique`
- `powerlevel`
- `fish`

### Agnoster [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#agnoster "Direct link to Agnoster")

Renders each intermediate folder as the `folder_icon` separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.
The first and the last (current) folder name are always displayed as-is.

### Agnoster Full [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#agnoster-full "Direct link to Agnoster Full")

Renders each folder name separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Agnoster Short [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#agnoster-short "Direct link to Agnoster Short")

When more than `max_depth` levels deep, it renders one `folder_icon` (if `hide_root_location` is `false`,
which means the root folder does not count for depth) followed by the names of the last `max_depth` folders,
separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Agnoster Left [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#agnoster-left "Direct link to Agnoster Left")

Renders each folder as the `folder_icon` separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.
Only the first folder name and its child are displayed in full.

### Full [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#full "Direct link to Full")

Display the current working directory as a full string with each folder separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Folder [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#folder "Direct link to Folder")

Display the name of the current folder.

### Mixed [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#mixed "Direct link to Mixed")

Works like `agnoster`, but for any intermediate folder name that is short enough, it will be displayed as-is.
The maximum length for the folders to display is governed by the `mixed_threshold` property.

### Letter [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#letter "Direct link to Letter")

Works like `agnoster_full`, but will write every folder name using the first letter only, except when the folder name
starts with a symbol or icon. Specially, the last (current) folder name is always displayed in full.

- `folder` will be shortened to `f`
- `.config` will be shortened to `.c`
- `__pycache__` will be shortened to `__p`
- `âž¼ folder` will be shortened to `âž¼ f`

### Unique [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#unique "Direct link to Unique")

Works like `letter`, but will make sure every folder name is the shortest unique value.

The uniqueness refers to the displayed path, so `C:\dev\dev\dev\development` will be displayed as
`C\d\de\dev\development` (instead of `C\d\d\d\development` for `Letter`). Uniqueness does **not** refer to other
folders at the same level, so if `C:\projectA\dev` and `C:\projectB\dev` exist, then both will be displayed as
`C\p\dev`.

### Powerlevel [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#powerlevel "Direct link to Powerlevel")

Works like `unique`, but will stop shortening when `max_width` is reached.

### Fish [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#fish "Direct link to Fish")

Works like `letter`, but will display the first `dir_length` characters of each folder name, except for the last
number of folders specified by `full_length_dirs`, which will be displayed in full. Inspired by the Fish shell PWD.

## Template ( [info](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates)) [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#template-info "Direct link to template-info")

### Properties [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/path\#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Path` | `string` | the current directory (based on the `style` property) |
| `.Parent` | `string` | the current directory's parent folder which ends with a path separator (designed for use with style `folder`, it is empty if `.Path` contains only one single element) |
| `.RootDir` | `boolean` | true if we're at the root directory (no parent) |
| `.Location` | `string` | the current directory (raw value) |
| `.StackCount` | `int` | the stack count |
| `.Writable` | `boolean` | is the current directory writable by the user or not |
| `.Format` | `function` | format any path based on the segment's settings (e.g. `{{ .Format .Segments.Git.RelativeDir }}`) |
