## What [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/command\#what "Direct link to What")

powershell

While powerful, it tends to take a lot of time executing the command on **PowerShell**.
Even with `â€“noprofile` it's noticeably slower compared to `sh`. It's advised to look at using
[environment variables](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates#environment-variables) when using PowerShell.

Command allows you run an arbitrary shell command. Be aware it spawn a new process to fetch the result, meaning
it will not be able to fetch session based context (look at abusing [environment variables](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/templates#environment-variables) for that).
When the command errors or returns an empty string, this segment isn't rendered.

You have the ability to use `||` or `&&` to stitch commands together and achieve complex results. When using `||`
the first command that returns a string will be used (or none when they all fail to produce output that's not an
error). The `&&` functionality will join the output of the commands when successful. If you want to run the command
as is, you can set `interpret` to `false`.
