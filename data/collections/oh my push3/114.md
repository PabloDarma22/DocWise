## Configuration [â€‹](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/upgrade\#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Oh My Posh can display the availability of an update, or auto update itself when
enabled by adding the following to your configuration.

- json
- yaml
- toml

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "upgrade": {
    "notice": true,
    "interval": "168h",
    "auto": false,
    "source": "cdn"
  }
}

```

info

Auto upgrade will never upgrade major versions. This is to avoid introducing breaking changes
without explicit user acknowledgement.

warning

Upgrade features are never enabled when you have `async` loading enabled in your configuration
and the shell you're using supports it.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `notice` | `boolean` | `false` | enable displaying the upgrade notice on shell start, only checks based on `interval` |
| `auto` | `boolean` | `false` | automatically update Oh My Posh when an update is found, only checks based on `interval` |
| `interval` | `string` | `24h` | the duration for which not to check for an update. The duration is a string in the format `1h2m3s` and is parsed using the \[time.ParseDuration\] function from the Go standard library |
| `source` | `string` | `cdn` | where to fetch the information from. Accepted values are `cdn` ( `https://cdn.ohmyposh.dev/releases/latest/version.txt`) and `github` ( `https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/version.txt`) |
